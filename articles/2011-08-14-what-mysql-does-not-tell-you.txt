<p><span>MYSQL can perform silent column changes whenever you CREATE or ALTER a table.These might be changes to a data type, to attributes associated with a data type, or to an index specification. Some notable changes are the following.</span></p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">VARCHAR columns specified less than four characters are silently converted to CHAR<font color="#b83000">&nbsp;[Before MySQL 5.0.3]</font></div>>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">All TIMESTAMP columns are converted to NOT NULL</div>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">String columns defined with a binary CHARACTER SET are converted to the corresponding binary data type; for example VARCHAR is converted to VARBINARY<font color="#b83000">&nbsp;[Before MySQL 5.0.3]</font></em></div>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">Columns that are part of a PRIMARY KEY are made NOT NULL even if not declared that way</div>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">Trailing spaces are automatically deleted from ENUM and SET member values when the table is created</div>
