There is official <a href="https://angular.io/guide/testing#configure-project-for-travis-ci" target="_blank">Angular documentation</a> which explains how to set up an Angular project with Travis CI. However its a bit confusing and includes multiple steps, at least for me. You need to create a new <code>protractor-ci.conf.js</code> file and alter the contents of the default <code>karma.conf.js</code> file. Chances are you completely miss this part and ends up with a failed Travis build. If you need a quick start Travis config file that works without altering multiple config files, then this post is for you.

Create a new file <code>.travis.yml</code> in your root directory. Paste the following.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/nikhilben/0186c3318e13ee8786b907a9cbdf735b.js"></script>

That's it! You are done.
