<span>Just uploaded my new Google Chrome extension, DuckDuckGo search. So what is DuckDuckGo ? DuckDuckGo is a search engine. You can use it instead of Google for : Zero-click Info, Privacy, Goodies and Less Spam.</span>

<span>The source code for the chrome extension is released under the GPL License and is hosted on Github.

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/nbkdotdev/DuckDuckGo
</code></pre>


<span><a href="http://duckduckgo.com" target="_blank">Duck Duck Go</a> is a search engine like <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>. Use it to get more Zero-click Info, more privacy, less spam, !bang syntax and lots of other goodies.  See <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/about.html" target="_blank">about page</a> for details. It has a traffic of 2 million direct <a href="http://http://duckduckgo.com/traffic.html" target="_blank">queries per month. </a>Duck Duck Go was solo-founded by <a href="http://ye.gg/">Gabriel Weinberg</a> in February 2008 and is based out of Valley Forge, PA (USA).  It has been self-funded to date.   It's also largely built <a href="http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2009/03/duck-duck-go-architecture.html">with <q>FOSS</q></a>.  They also <a href="http://ye.gg/tithe">give 10% of our income</a> to FOSS.</span>
