<span><a href="http://phonegap.com" target="_blank">PhoneGap</a> is an HTML5 app platform that allows you to author native applications for Android, iPhone, WebOS, Symbian, Windows Phone or Blackberry with web technologies and get access to APIs and app stores. I have been working on phonegap for a while now. Although it is considered easy, its little bit tricky to get it work as expected. I found it difficult to get a solution to upload a file from SD Card to a remote server using phonegap. After little bit of googling and failed attempts, I decided to hack it myself and got it working.</span>
