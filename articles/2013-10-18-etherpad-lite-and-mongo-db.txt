By default <a href="https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite" target="_blank">Etherpad</a> seems to support dirty, postgres, sqlite and mysql databases. But it can also be configured to use with <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> with a little hack. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Pita/ueberDB" target="_blank">UeberDB</a>, the database abstraction layer used in Etherpad. This means, it can also be configured to use with level, redis, Cassandra or CouchDB. I will focus this tutorial for MongoDB integration, but same method can be used to make Etherpad work with other DataBase systems (Which are supported by UeberDB).
